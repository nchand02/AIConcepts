    <h2>1.1 What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> is the science and engineering of creating intelligent 
      machines that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks include visual 
      perception, speech recognition, decision-making, language translation, and problem-solving.
    </p>

    <h3>Defining Intelligence</h3>
    
    <p>
      Intelligence manifests in multiple forms. AI researchers typically focus on computational intelligence—the 
      ability to acquire, process, and apply knowledge to solve problems. Modern AI systems demonstrate these capabilities:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Drawing logical conclusions from available information (e.g., GPT-4 passing the bar exam with human-level scores)</li>
      <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Improving performance through experience (e.g., AlphaGo Zero learning chess from self-play alone)</li>
      <li><strong>Perception:</strong> Interpreting sensory data (e.g., computer vision models achieving >99% accuracy on ImageNet)</li>
      <li><strong>Language Processing:</strong> Understanding and generating natural language (e.g., modern LLMs producing coherent, contextual responses)</li>
      <li><strong>Problem Solving:</strong> Finding solutions to complex challenges (e.g., AlphaFold 2 solving protein folding in hours vs. months)</li>
      <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> Generating novel content across text, images, video, and audio (e.g., DALL-E, Midjourney, Sora)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout info">
      <div class="callout-title">💡 Modern AI Capabilities</div>
      <p>
        As of 2025, AI systems have achieved remarkable milestones: passing professional exams (law, medicine), 
        creating original artwork, composing music, writing code, discovering new antibiotics, and assisting in 
        scientific research. The line between "AI" and "just software" continues to blur—many capabilities once 
        considered AI are now simply expected features.

    <h3>The Turing Test</h3>
    
    <p>
      In 1950, Alan Turing proposed a practical test for machine intelligence: if a human evaluator cannot 
      reliably distinguish between a machine and a human through text-based conversation, the machine can be 
      said to exhibit intelligent behavior. While controversial, this test influenced decades of AI research.

      <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>
          Modern AI research has moved beyond the Turing Test to more nuanced measures:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Task-Specific Benchmarks:</strong> ImageNet for vision, MMLU/HELM for LLMs, HumanEval for code generation</li>

          <li><strong>Mathematical Reasoning:</strong> IMO (International Mathematical Olympiad) problems - Google's systems achieved gold medal standard in 2025</li>
          <li><strong>Efficiency Metrics:</strong> Performance relative to compute, data, and energy consumption</li>
          <li><strong>Robustness:</strong> Behavior under adversarial conditions, out-of-distribution generalization</li>
          <li><strong>Alignment & Safety:</strong> Following intended goals, avoiding harmful outputs, truthfulness</li>
          <li><strong>Scientific Discovery:</strong> Novel contributions to research (e.g., AlphaFold's protein structures, AI-discovered antibiotics)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em>Source: François Chollet states about ARC-AGI: "You'll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating 
          tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible."</em>

        <p>
          AI has experienced several "winters"—periods of reduced funding and interest:
        </p>
        <h4>First AI Winter (1974-1980)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Limitations of perceptrons exposed by Minsky & Papert</li>
          <li>Failure to achieve early promises led to funding cuts</li>
          <li>Computational constraints limited practical applications</li>

          <li>Market for specialized AI hardware collapsed</li>
          <li>Shift toward more statistical approaches</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These winters taught important lessons about managing expectations and the importance of 
          theoretical foundations backed by empirical success.

      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>1.3 AI Paradigms</h2>

    <p>AI research has evolved through several distinct paradigms:</p>

    <h3>Symbolic AI (GOFAI - Good Old-Fashioned AI)</h3>
    
    <p>
      The earliest approach to AI, dominant from the 1950s through 1980s. Symbolic AI represents knowledge 
      using symbols and rules, manipulating them through logical inference.
    </p>

    <pre set:html={`<code># Example: Simple rule-based expert system
# Dominant AI paradigm 1960s-1980s, still used in specific domains (e.g., business rules)
rules = [
    ("IF animal has feathers THEN animal is bird", 0.9),
    ("IF animal is bird AND animal swims THEN animal is waterfowl", 0.95),
    ("IF animal is waterfowl AND animal is white THEN animal is swan", 0.8)
]

# Initial facts from observation
facts = {{"has feathers": True, "swims": True, "is white": True}}

def infer(rules, facts):
    """Forward chaining inference engine
    
    This approach works well for well-defined domains but struggles with:
    - Uncertainty and noisy data (addressed by probabilistic methods)
    - Learning from examples (neural networks excel here)
    - Common sense reasoning (still challenging as of 2025)
    
    Modern systems often combine symbolic reasoning with neural approaches.
    """
    inferred = facts.copy()
    changed = True
    while changed:
        changed = False
        for rule, confidence in rules:
            # Parse and evaluate rule (simplified)
            if evaluate_rule(rule, inferred):
                conclusion = extract_conclusion(rule)
                if conclusion not in inferred:
                    inferred[conclusion] = confidence
                    changed = True
    return inferred

# Example inference:
# Input: {{'has feathers': True, 'swims': True, 'is white': True}}
# Output: {{'has feathers': True, 'swims': True, 'is white': True, 
#          'is bird': 0.9, 'is waterfowl': 0.95, 'is swan': 0.8}}</code>`} />

    <div class="callout warning">
      <div class="callout-title">⚠️ Limitations of Symbolic AI</div>
      <p>
        While powerful for well-defined domains, symbolic AI struggles with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Brittleness:</strong> Rules don't generalize beyond their specific domain</li>
        <li><strong>Knowledge Acquisition Bottleneck:</strong> Manually encoding expertise is time-consuming</li>
        <li><strong>Uncertainty:</strong> Real-world knowledge is often probabilistic, not absolute</li>
        <li><strong>Common Sense:</strong> Difficult to encode tacit human knowledge</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Statistical Learning</h3>
    
    <p>
      Beginning in the 1990s, AI shifted toward statistical and probabilistic methods. Instead of hand-coding 
      rules, systems learned patterns from data.
    </p>

    <pre class="mermaid" set:html={`graph LR

    style D fill:#10b981,stroke:#059669,color:#fff
      `} />

    <h3>Connectionist AI (Neural Networks)</h3>
    
    <p>
      Inspired by biological neurons, neural networks learn by adjusting connection weights between simple 
      processing units. This approach became dominant with the deep learning revolution of the 2010s.
    </p>

    <h3>Hybrid Approaches</h3>
    
    <p>
      Modern AI often combines multiple paradigms. State-of-the-art systems in 2025 increasingly leverage hybrid architectures:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Neural-Symbolic Integration:</strong> Combining neural learning with logical reasoning (e.g., AlphaGeometry proving mathematical theorems)</li>
      <li><strong>Differentiable Programming:</strong> Making symbolic operations compatible with gradient descent (e.g., neural module networks)</li>
      <li><strong>Foundation Models + Tools:</strong> LLMs calling external knowledge bases, APIs, and specialized tools (e.g., ChatGPT with web browsing, code interpreter, DALL-E integration)</li>
      <li><strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):</strong> Neural models accessing structured knowledge bases (covered in Chapter 8)</li>
      <li><strong>Tree Search + Neural Networks:</strong> Combining classical search with learned heuristics (e.g., AlphaGo, AlphaZero, MuZero)</li>
      <li><strong>Neurosymbolic Reasoning:</strong> LLMs enhanced with formal verification, constraint solvers, and knowledge graphs</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="callout success">
      <div class="callout-title">✨ The Future is Hybrid</div>
      <p>
        The most powerful AI systems of the 2020s don't rely on a single approach. Instead, they combine the pattern 
        recognition capabilities of neural networks with the precision of symbolic reasoning, the efficiency of 
        algorithmic search, and the breadth of large-scale data. This "best of all worlds" strategy is likely to 
        dominate AI development through the 2030s.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>1.4 Search and Problem Solving</h2>

    <p>
      Many AI problems can be formulated as search: finding a path from an initial state to a goal state 
      through a space of possible states.
    </p>

    <h3>Search Space</h3>
    
    <div class="ascii-diagram">
                    Start
                     |
